    <h1>New York</h1>
    <p>New York City comprises 5 boroughs sitting where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean. <br>At its core is Manhattan, a densely populated borough that’s among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers. <br>Its iconic sites include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and sprawling Central Park.<br> Broadway theater is staged in neon-lit Times Square.<br>In 1624 the Dutch established a colony on what’s now Manhattan Island called New Amsterdam.<br> It was renamed New York once the British took control of the area in 1664. </p>

    <h4>Grab a slice at L'Industrie Pizzeria</h4>
    <p>Considered by many to be one of the best places to get pizza in NYC, <br>L'Industrie was established by owner Massimo Laveglia, a Tuscany native, in Williamsburg back in 2017.<br> And people have been lining up for slices ever since.

        Our take: L'Industrie has the perfect slice—the hot pizza and cold burrata combo is delicious every single time.<br> I also love the dedication the owner has to creating a place that has character, <br>which is evident the second you walk into either location. — Sarah Iandoli, social media editor </p>
